REMEMBER TO INCLUDE stat.h IN ALL THESE FILES 

Files to modify (non-comprehensive):
    
    cat.c - increase read counter
    exec.c (maybe??) - what is this file even doing?
    file.c - fileread and filewrite functions maybe?
    fs.c - idk, these are really low level, might be too low
    ls.c
    pipe.c (maybe? def qualifies but might not want to)
    printf.c
    stressfs.c
    sysfile.c (maybe??) - higer level than fs.c, good candidate    

Edit file.h to include the bytes read and written
Figure out how to make a new system call using an fd
