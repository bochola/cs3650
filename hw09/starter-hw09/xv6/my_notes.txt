Files to modify (non-comprehensive):
    
    syscall.c (relies on syscall.h)
    user.h
    usys.S
    sysfile.c (implements in file.c which relies on file.h)
    
    exec.c (maybe??) - what is this file even doing?

Figure out how to make a new system call using an fd, following
the fstat syscall will help

I have no idea what I'm doing
