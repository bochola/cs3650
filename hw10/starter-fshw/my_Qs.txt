The single inderect blocks for storing larger data files is a bit confusing to me
Nat's video at ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1OxG2zlAnE&feature=youtu.be  )
at the 12 minute mark he starts talking about it and I dont get what he means by blocks
exactly. Does he mean like, the pointers are stored in the actual data block? Where is
he getting this 12 number from, why are there 12 to work with?
